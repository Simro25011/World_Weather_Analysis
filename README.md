# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

After a three-year Covid-19 pandemic, travel and tourism is back. Helping future travelers plan their vacations becomes even more important. Our mission is to provide real-time recommendations for ideal hotels based on our clients' weather preferences. To accomplish our mission, we first created a beta version of the application for customers to use. The goal is to ensure that when the app launches, every user gets a real-time travel destination with hotel options and itineraries based on their weather preferences. In this current beta test , the tester wanted potential destinations with max temperatures between  75°F and 90°F.
